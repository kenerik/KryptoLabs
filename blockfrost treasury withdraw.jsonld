    "comment": "As Krypto Labs, engaged in the 2025 budget process since February, I am voting YES on the â‚³1,300,000 Blockfrost Platform proposal.\nThis decision stems from Blockfrost's critical role in simplifying blockchain access, having powered most of transactions at peak on Cardano, and the urgent need to decentralize it via the Icebreakers program.\n\nThe proposal's strengths open sourcing components, rewarding SPOs with revenue sharing, and integrating for micropayments directly address centralization risks while empowering developers and operators.\nMilestones like 100 active Icebreakers by year end, tracked transparently on GitHub with audits, ensure accountability. Community endorsements from DReps emphasize its alignment with core engineering, decentralization priorities and potentially boosting adoption.\n\nMy involvement in workshops revealed Blockfrost's ecosystem value; approving this accelerates a resilient, SPO-driven network, fostering Cardano's growth without excessive risk."
