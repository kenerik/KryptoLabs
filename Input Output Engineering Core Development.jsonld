    "comment": "As a dedicated Cardano DRep, Krypto Labs has actively participated in the 2025 budget process since February, contributing to workshops, forums, and discussions to ensure proposals align with the community's longterm vision for decentralization, scalability, and innovation. After carefully evaluating the pros and cons, drawing from the proposal's detailed roadmap, comparative analyses against alternatives like the TSC proposal, and broader ecosystem feedback. I am voting YES on this treasury withdrawal\n\nThis decision is rooted in IOE's unmatched expertise as the architects of Cardano's foundational elements, including Ouroboros and Plutus, which have proven resilient through peer-reviewed research and real-world deployment. The proposal addresses pressing challenges like scalability limitations (via Leios and Hydra) and smart contract security (via Plutus High Assurance tools), delivering tangible benefits such as reduced node costs for SPOs, faster transactions for users, and enhanced tools for developers, essential for Cardano's competitiveness in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. While the ₳96.8M cost is substantial, it represents a strategic investment within the approved ₳350m NCL, backed by milestone based accountability, thirdparty audits, and Intersect's transparent smart contract framework, minimizing risks of mismanagement.\n\nCriticisms regarding IO's past slow pace and potential centralization are valid, as acknowledged by Charles Hoskinson himself, but the proposal incorporates shifts toward modularity (e.g., Acropolis) and knowledge sharing to foster greater community involvement and supplier diversity. Alternatives like the TSC proposal offer agility, but they lack IOE's depth in high assurance engineering, which is crucial for mission critical features like consensus upgrades. Given my involvement since February, I've seen firsthand how this aligns with community priorities for sustainable growth, outweighing risks like delays or opportunity costs. Approving this will accelerate Cardano's roadmap, boost adoption, and reinforce its position as a secure, scalable platform ultimately benefiting all stakeholders"
