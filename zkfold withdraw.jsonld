    "comment": "Krypto Labs endorse funding the zkFold ZK Rollup proposal for its transformative potential in addressing scalability challenges. zkFold SA aims to develop a general purpose zero knowledge rollup as a Layer 2 solution, bundling hundreds of transactions into batches for on chain verification, boosting throughput, reducing fees, and alleviating congestion.\n\nThe proposal's milestones transaction aggregation server, wallet and indexer APIs, validation logic and dApp toolkit are feasible. Their team of Haskell, Rust, and ZKP experts has delivered prior Catalyst projects (e.g., ZK Prover Backend, zkWrapper), with progress toward TestNet evident in open source GitHub repos and X updates.\n\nBudgeted at $860k over 12 months (milestone-based fixed price), including maintenance, it ensures efficient scaling for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs, enhancing user experience and adoption. No redundancies with efforts like Hydra; it complements Cardano's eUTxO model. This is sustainable growth, leveraging zkFold's proven expertise to make Cardano more competitive and accessible."
