    "comment": "Krypto Labs is proud to cast a definitive 'YES' vote in favor of the proposed Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Info Action. Our decision stems from deep engagement and conviction in the robust, community-driven process that shaped this vital initiative. We have actively participated in numerous budget AMA meetings, dedicated pre-budget work, and engaged in extensive debates across various community forums, including X Spaces and private discussions. Our concerns and support have been consistently voiced through voting on both GovTool and the Ekklesia platform.\n\nThis budget, totaling 275,269,340 ada, represents a critical aggregate allocation that directly fuels the Cardano vision and roadmap for 2025 and beyond. The meticulous process, which saw over 3.8 billion ada in DRep stake participation and required over 50% support for included proposals, demonstrates a truly decentralized and accountable approach to resource allocation. We commend Intersect's role in facilitating this transparent and inclusive mechanism.\n\nWe believe the proposed framework, with Intersect as Administrator and the commitment to smart contract-based oversight, provides essential safeguards for fund management and ensures accountability. This budget is not merely a financial allocation; it is a testament to the community's collective effort to drive Cardano's future through sustained development, innovation, and governance. Krypto Labs is confident this budget will empower the ecosystem to achieve its ambitious goals."
