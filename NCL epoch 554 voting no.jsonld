    "comment": "As Cardano delegated representative Krypto Labs, we propose voting no to the 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL) proposal, submitted on April 25, 2025, as an \"Info\" governance action (ID: gov_action10k0unljvaej0kd89w7pn0zkgdx59c7xkl0x5q78dzvdtd73u0kmqq5xl5y5), setting the treasury withdrawal cap at 200 million ADA for Epochs 532 to 604 (approximately eight months of 2025). This decision is rooted in the Cardano Constitution, CIP-1694, and the need to ensure the long-term sustainability and stability of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.\n\n1. Prior NCL Establishment\nOn April 24, 2025, in Epoch 553, a 350 million ADA NCL was approved and deemed constitutional by the Constitutional Committee. This prior NCL must guide budget actions to maintain consistency as the constitution says “Such budgets are expected to cover not less than a period of 73 epochs (approximately one calendar year) but nothing shall prevent the Cardano Community from proposing budgets for shorter or longer time periods”\nChanging the NCH now will make such expectations obsolete.\n\n2. Disruption to Budget Planning: Introducing a new 200 million ADA NCL is counterproductive, as it disrupts ongoing budget proposals reliant on the 350 million ADA limit. Vendors, suppliers, and proposers have proposed deliveries, KPIs, and milestones based on this established limit since March 2025. Changing the NCL mid-process undermines their ability to execute effectively, risking delays and reduced ecosystem productivity\n\n3. DRep Accountability and Consistency: Approving the 350 million ADA NCL was a deliberate governance action, not a trial. DReps must uphold consistency to foster trust and predictability in the ecosystem. Frequent NCL changes via \"Info\" actions erode confidence and contradict the Constitution’s emphasis on sustainable treasury management.\n\n4. Lack of Evidentiary Support: The 200 million ADA proposal lacks robust research to justify reducing the NCL. While it cites 2024 treasury replenishment models estimating 350 million ADA annually, it assumes a lower limit is safer without evidence that the higher limit would harm the treasury (Proposal Metadata). Proposars operating since March 2025 have relied on the communicated 350 million ADA framework, and altering it based on speculation disrupts their efforts.\n\n5. Need for Structural Governance Improvements: While audit and transparency are critical, reducing the NCL does not address these issues. Instead, it underscores the need for an 8th governance action to manage NCL and budget parameters on-chain, as discussed in CIP-1694’s Edinburgh debates. A treasury working group, yet to be formed, is essential to develop on-chain guardrails and ensure transparent, community-driven treasury management.\nVoting no preserves the established 350 million ADA NCL, supports ecosystem stability, and advocates for a dedicated governance mechanism to address treasury management comprehensively. This stance aligns with the Cardano Constitution’s principles and prioritizes the ecosystem’s long-term viability.\n"
