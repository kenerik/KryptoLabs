    "comment": "Krypto Labs advocates for a “yes” vote on this governance action, proposing a Net Change Limit (NCL) of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350 million ADA) for 2025, spanning Epoch 532 to Epoch 604 (approximately January to December 2025). This aligns with our core stance from the prior action: prioritizing a fixed-amount NCL over a percentage-based one for practicality and clarity, ensuring the treasury remains robust to fund Cardano’s ecosystem growth.\nThe Cardano Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) mandates an NCL before budget requests, validated by Appendix I’s Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails (TREASURY-01a), requiring DRep approval. This proposal’s 350 million ADA limit is grounded in 2024 treasury inflow data (335,957,093 ADA from Epoch 459-531), within 5% of the October 2024 projection (351 million ADA), justifying its retention. Setting the NCL based on prior inflows incentivizes projects to boost blockchain utility, enhancing transaction volumes and ecosystem value—key to Cardano’s ascent among layer 1 blockchains.\nWe favor this approach over a percentage-based NCL due to its simplicity and direct link to tangible outcomes, avoiding the complexity of fluctuating inflow calculations. The 350 million ADA cap ensures sustainability, balancing withdrawals with inflows to maintain Cardano’s “financial hammer” for innovation and adoption. Community feedback suggesting a 67% DRep threshold (matching treasury withdrawal standards) is noted, but the Constitution requires only >50% active voting stake, which we adopt for this vote.\nVoting “yes” ensures transparency, accountability, and alignment with constitutional mandates, enabling budget and withdrawal actions without risking depletion. As community members, Krypto Labs emphasizes timely approval to prevent delays that could stall Cardano’s progress, fostering long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\n"
