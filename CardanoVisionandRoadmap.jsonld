    "comment": "Krypto Labs the DRep for the Nordic community, we support voting yes on the Cardano Vision Roadmap 2025, as it aligns with our needs and enhances the blockchain’s future.\n\nKrypto Labs has engaged our community via YouTube and Facebook, explaining the roadmap transparently. We’ve also joined roadmap presentations, asking questions to clarify details. Community feedback highlights enthusiasm for faster transactions, Bitcoin integration, and new dApps—goals the roadmap directly targets, solidifying our yes vote.\nThe roadmap boosts Layer 1 scalability with the Leios protocol and codebase optimization, promising quicker, cheaper transactions. This is vital for handling growing demand, ensuring Cardano remains efficient for users in payments and smart contracts. Interoperability is another focus, integrating Bitcoin via zero-knowledge proofs and Babel Fees. This could bring Bitcoin’s liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, offering users more yield and utility while attracting new participants.\nConcerns about complexity—like implementing Leios or tweaking SPO incentives—are real but manageable. Cardano’s methodical, research-backed approach, paired with phased execution and governance input, reduces risks and keeps the community involved. This balance of ambition and practicality underpins its likely success.\nVoting yes supports a scalable, interoperable, and innovative Cardano, matching our community’s vision. It’s a strategic move to ensure the platform thrives, benefiting the Nordic region with a robust ecosystem. Through our engagement, I’ve seen the excitement for these changes. We are confident this roadmap will drive Cardano forward.\n"
